ToolKit
=======

A library of reusable classes and abstractions to make writing code easier.

History
-------------

I and a couple of previous co-workers (but mostly me) collected c# methods from various sources, adapted others, and created new methods and objects which were put into a reusable library that could be used in various projects. Some of the collected/adapted code, we kept track of the source, most of it we didn't. We didn’t typically worry about licensing or the source of the code because:
  1. We were developing internal applications for our employer;
  2. Those application were not being redistributed;
  3. We were young and naïve and didn’t think it was important. (BTW, we were wrong about that…)

For many years I've been hesitant to post this library of code up on a public web site since we didn’t keep track of which code we created, what code was adapted, and what code was copied. However, we always had a strong desire to do so because this library wouldn’t exist without the contributions of many which power open-source development.

If you are concerned about licensing within your application or company, do not use this library. If you see some code that is not attributed correctly, let me know and I'll get the code updated and properly attributed. I will include the needed license files for redistribution. However, I will remove any code that is licensed too restrictively since the purpose of sharing this code is to provide as much flexibility as possible. If you are the author of the code and do not want it included in this library, contact me and I'll remove it. If you want to contribute to the library, send me an email or a pull request.

Licensing Of This Library
-------------

Code that has been generated directly or code that has no source information for will be licensed under the liberal open-source Apache license since, unlike the GPL-based licenses that impact all projects that uses GPL licensed code, it provides the level of flexibility I'd like to provide/use. It is not my intention to take credit for other’s work. I believe that good, successful developers stand on the shoulders of giants and that those who follow will stand on ours. I also understand that we all have to make money and sometimes that means writing non-open-source code under propriety licenses. I think that the Apache license will provide for that while allowing me to incorporate as much of the collected and adapted code as possible. Where licenses are incompatible, I’ll separate the code into a separate library licensed under the incompatible license so as to allow as much flexibility as possible.
