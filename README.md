A library of reusable classes and abstractions to make writing code easier.

History
-------------

I and several co-workers and friends collected c# methods from various sources, adapted others, and created new methods and objects into a reusable library that we could use in our various projects. Some of the collected/adapted code, we kept track of the source, most of it we didn't. We didn’t typically worry about licensing or the source of the code because:
  1. We were developing internal applications for our employer;
  2. Those application were not being redistributed;
  3. We were young and naïve and didn’t think it was important. (BTW, we were wrong…)

For many years we been hesitant to post this library of code up on the web since we didn’t keep track of which code we created, what code was adapted, and what code was copied. However, we always had a strong desire to do so because this library wouldn’t exist without the contributions of many which power open-source development.

Several of the original team-mates now work for other employers but still sometimes contribute bugs, bug fixes, and new features to this library. Sometimes we share and sometimes we don’t. When we do share, we typically done it via email. This is very inefficient and makes me the bottle-neck to incorporate the code into the library. It has also put up a barrier to sharing. Given these concerns, I'm posting the code into this repository. 

If you are concerned about licensing, do not use this library. If you see some code that is not attributed correctly, let me know and I'll get the code updated and properly attributed. I will include the needed license files for redistribution. I will remove any code that is licensed too restrictively. If you are the author of the code and do not want it included in this library, contact me and I'll remove it. Code that we generate directly, will be licensed under a liberal open-source license as soon as we figure out which one we want to use. If you want to contribute to the library, send me an email or a pull request. 

It is not my intention to take credit for other’s work. I believe that good, successful developers stand on the shoulders of giants and that those who follow will stand on ours. I also believe that we all have to make money and sometimes that means writing non-open-source code under a propriety license. I hope to find a license that provides for that while allowing me to incorporate as much of the collected and adapted code as possible. Where licenses are incompatible, I’ll separate the code into separate libraries that will allow as much flexibility as possible.
